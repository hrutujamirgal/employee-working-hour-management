   - Forms for task management and leave requests.
   - Dashboards displaying relevant data for each role.

2. **Backend (Node.js & Express.js):**
   - RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for tasks, attendance, and user management.
   - Middleware for request validation and authorization.

3. **Database (MongoDB):**
   - Schemas for users, tasks, attendance logs, and leave requests.
   - Role-based access control data structure.

### Example Features and Functionalities

- **Employee Dashboard:**
  - View assigned tasks with status updates.
  - Log working hours.

### Conclusion
The Employee Working Hour Monitoring App offers a comprehensive solution for managing remote employees, ensuring that they adhere to the required working hours while providing managers and the CEO with the tools necessary to oversee productivity and performance. The use of the MERN stack ensures a scalable and efficient application, while strict authentication and authorization measures protect sensitive data.
